# Quality Checks & Template Standard

## Template standard (required format)
A compliant `TEMPLATE.md` should include:
1. **Title** and **purpose** at the top.
2. **Documentation map** linking to `DOCUMENTACAO.md` or `DOCUMENTACAO/`.
3. **Numbered sections** with clear headings.
4. **Placeholders** using `{{snake_case}}` for inputs.
5. **Inline documentation links** for each major section.

If a template deviates:
- Normalize headings and numbering.
- Add a documentation map if missing.
- Convert ad-hoc placeholders to `{{...}}`.
- Preserve original content and intent.
- Keep edits minimal and traceable.

## Review checklist (apply to create/update/review)
- [ ] All required sections from the template are present.
- [ ] Inputs are mapped to placeholders (no required fields left blank without explanation).
- [ ] Content aligns with `DOCUMENTACAO` guidance.
- [ ] Terminology is consistent across sections.
- [ ] References and links are valid and traceable.
- [ ] Document control metadata/history is updated when changes occur.

## Common issues to flag
- Missing sections or headings from the template.
- Placeholders left in the final artifact without justification.
- Inconsistent scope statements vs. objectives/benefits.
- No traceability to risks, assumptions, or stakeholders.
- Document controls not updated after edits.
