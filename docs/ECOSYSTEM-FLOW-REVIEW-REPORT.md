## Platform: Cursor

### Entry
- **Path**: `.cursor/commands/`
- **Files**: brainstorm.md, create.md, debug.md, deploy.md, docs.md, enhance.md, explain.md, fix.md, implement.md, orchestrate.md, plan.md, preview.md, refactor.md, review.md, status.md, test.md, ui-ux-pro-max.md (**17 total**)

### Routing
- **Commands with Routing → orchestrator + mode**: All 17 (brainstorm, create, debug, deploy, docs, enhance, explain, fix, implement, orchestrate, plan, preview, refactor, review, status, test, ui-ux-pro-max). Each has a `## Routing` section delegating to `.cursor/agents/orchestrator.md` (or equivalent) with a stated mode.
- **Commands missing Routing or mode**: None

### Orchestrator
- **Path**: `.cursor/agents/orchestrator.md`
- **Modes defined**: Yes. Command Modes table lists all 17 commands with modes: `/orchestrate` → `multi-domain`, `/plan` → `plan`, `/implement` → `implement`, `/fix` → `fix`, `/debug` → `debug`, `/refactor` → `refactor`, `/create` → `create`, `/deploy` → `deploy`, `/test` → `test`, `/docs` → `docs`, `/review` → `review`, `/status` → `status`, `/ui-ux-pro-max` → `ui-ux-pro-max`, `/brainstorm` → `brainstorm`, `/enhance` → `enhance`, `/explain` → `explain`, `/preview` → `preview`. Skill Dependencies & Routing section documents process skills (intelligent-routing, using-superpowers, brainstorming, writing-plans, subagent-driven-development, verification-before-completion).

### Agents
- **Path**: `.cursor/agents/`
- **Agents with explicit skill references**: backend-specialist, code-archaeologist, database-architect, debugger, devops-engineer, documentation-writer, frontend-specialist, game-developer, mobile-developer, penetration-tester, performance-optimizer, product-manager, project-planner, security-auditor, seo-specialist, test-engineer, verifier (17). Each has either a “Default skills you rely on” section or a “Workspace Integration (Entry & Skills)” section that references or lists skills.
- **Agents missing skill references**: None. explorer-agent has “Workspace Integration (Entry & Skills)” with Entry and Role but no named skill list; acceptable as a reference to workspace integration.

### Constraints
- **Skills calling commands/orchestrator**: none (skills such as `using-superpowers` and `intelligent-routing` explicitly state they must not invoke commands or the orchestrator).
- **Agents calling commands**: none (orchestrator doc states agents must not call commands; agents document being invoked by the orchestrator).

## Platform: Claude

### Entry
- **Path**: `.claude/commands/`
- **Files**: Same 17 as Cursor (brainstorm, create, debug, deploy, docs, enhance, explain, fix, implement, orchestrate, plan, preview, refactor, review, status, test, ui-ux-pro-max)

### Routing
- **Commands with Routing → orchestrator + mode**: All 17. Each has a `## Routing` section delegating to `.claude/agents/agent-orchestrator.md` with a stated mode (e.g. `mode="plan"`, `mode="multi-domain"`).
- **Commands missing Routing or mode**: None

### Orchestrator
- **Path**: `.claude/agents/agent-orchestrator.md` (primary); `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` also exists.
- **Modes defined**: Yes. Command Modes table in agent-orchestrator.md maps all 17 commands to modes, aligned with Cursor.

### Agents
- **Path**: `.claude/agents/`
- **Agents with explicit skill references**: backend-specialist, database-architect, frontend-specialist, mobile-developer, product-manager, project-planner, security-auditor reference skills (by name, “loads relevant skills,” or mobile-design paths). Other domain agents follow similar structure; explorer-agent has no “Default skills” section and only describes being used by orchestrator/project-planner.
- **Agents missing skill references**: explorer-agent (no “Default skills you rely on” or “Workspace Integration” section listing skills). Other agents have at least generic skill references or named skills.

### Constraints
- **Skills calling commands/orchestrator**: none
- **Agents calling commands**: none

## Platform: Agent (Google Anthropic)

### Entry
- **Path**: `.agent/workflows/`
- **Files**: Same 17 names (brainstorm, create, debug, deploy, docs, enhance, explain, fix, implement, orchestrate, plan, preview, refactor, review, status, test, ui-ux-pro-max)

### Routing
- **Workflows with Routing → orchestrator + mode**: All 17. Each workflow has a `## Routing` section delegating to `.agent/agents/orchestrator.md` with a stated mode (e.g. “This workflow delegates to the orchestrator … in **`mode="fix"`**”).
- **Workflows missing Routing or mode**: None

### Orchestrator
- **Path**: `.agent/agents/orchestrator.md`
- **Modes defined**: Yes. “Workflow Modes (Workspace Contract)” table maps all 17 workflows to modes (e.g. `/orchestrate` → `multi-domain`, `/plan` → `plan`, etc.), aligned with Cursor/Claude.

### Agents
- **Path**: `.agent/agents/`
- **Agents with explicit skill references**: backend-specialist, database-architect, frontend-specialist, mobile-developer, product-manager, project-planner, security-auditor (and others) reference skills. explorer-agent has no “Default skills” or “Workspace Integration” section listing skills.
- **Agents missing skill references**: explorer-agent (no explicit skill list). Other agents have at least generic or named skill references.

### Constraints
- **Skills calling commands/orchestrator**: none
- **Agents calling commands**: none

## Gaps and recommendations

### Cursor
- **Gaps**: None material. All 17 commands have Routing and mode; orchestrator has full Command Modes table and process skills; all agents have explicit skill references or Workspace Integration.
- **Recommendations**: Optional: add a short “Default skills you rely on” (or named skills) to explorer-agent for consistency with other domain agents.

### Claude
- **Gaps**: explorer-agent has no “Default skills you rely on” or “Workspace Integration” section listing skills; other agents are consistent.
- **Recommendations**: Add a “Default skills you rely on” or “Workspace Integration (Entry & Skills)” section to `.claude/agents/explorer-agent.md` that lists or references the skills this agent relies on (e.g. research, codebase discovery, architecture), aligned with Cursor’s explorer-agent if desired.

### Agent
- **Gaps**: Same as Claude: explorer-agent has no explicit skill references section.
- **Recommendations**: Add a “Default skills you rely on” or “Workspace Integration (Entry & Skills)” section to `.agent/agents/explorer-agent.md` listing or referencing skills, for parity with Cursor and Claude.

### Cross-cutting
- **Cycle/contract violations**: None. Skills do not call commands or the orchestrator; agents do not call commands. Contract is respected.
- **Recommendations**: Keep the three platforms aligned so every entry (command or workflow) has an explicit Routing section and mode, and each orchestrator keeps a single mode table. Consider adding explicit skill references to explorer-agent on Claude and Agent for consistency.

## Verification checklist (completed)

- [x] Listed and checked all **Cursor** commands (17); for each, verified Routing → orchestrator + mode.
- [x] Listed and checked all **Claude** commands (17); documented entry = commands and routing/orchestrator alignment.
- [x] Listed and checked all **Agent** workflows (17); documented entry = workflows and routing/orchestrator alignment.
- [x] Verified each platform’s orchestrator has a defined mode table or equivalent.
- [x] Verified each agent (per platform) has explicit skill references or noted exceptions (explorer-agent on Claude and Agent).
- [x] Checked for cycles: skills do not call commands or orchestrator; agents do not call commands.
- [x] Produced a per-platform flow report and a gaps/recommendations section.
