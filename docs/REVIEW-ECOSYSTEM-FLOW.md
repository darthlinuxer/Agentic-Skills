# Ecosystem Flow Review — Prompt

Use this document as the prompt. Execute the instructions below on this repository and produce the requested output. Do not edit this file when running the review; treat it as read-only instructions.

## Your task

Review the **entire flow** of the agentic ecosystem for **each platform** (Cursor, Claude, Google Anthropic Agent) according to the guidelines below. Produce a **structured report** per platform and a **gaps and recommendations** section.

**Contract:**

- **Cursor**: User must first call **commands**. Commands must route to the **orchestrator** agent, which distributes work among **agents**. Each agent must have **their own skills**. Check **all** commands.
- **Claude**: Review starts from **commands** (same entry point as Cursor).
- **Google Anthropic (Agent)**: Review starts from **workflows** (not commands).

**Flow per platform:**

1. **Entry** — Where the user starts (commands or workflows).
2. **Routing** — Each entry delegates to the orchestrator with a defined mode (or document why it does not).
3. **Orchestrator** — Receives by mode; uses process skills; invokes agents.
4. **Agents** — Each has a defined domain and references to skills (own skills).
5. **Constraints** — Skills never call commands or the orchestrator; agents do not call commands; users only use entries.

## Instructions

### 1. Cursor (`.cursor/`)

- **Entry**: List all command files in `.cursor/commands/` (expect 17: brainstorm, create, debug, deploy, docs, enhance, explain, fix, implement, orchestrate, plan, preview, refactor, review, status, test, ui-ux-pro-max).
- **Routing**: For each command file, verify the presence of a **## Routing** section that:
  - Delegates to the orchestrator (reference to `.cursor/agents/orchestrator.md` or equivalent).
  - States the **mode** (e.g. `mode="plan"`, `mode="multi-domain"`) consistent with the Command Modes table in `.cursor/agents/orchestrator.md`.
- **Orchestrator**: Confirm the orchestrator document lists each command’s mode and describes which agents/skills are used for that mode.
- **Agents**: For each agent file in `.cursor/agents/`, confirm it references or lists its own skills (e.g. a “Default skills you rely on” section, or explicit skill paths/references).
- **Report**: Note any command missing a Routing section or incorrect/missing mode; note any agent missing explicit skill references.

### 2. Claude (`.claude/`)

- **Entry**: Start from `.claude/commands/`. List all command files (same 17 names as Cursor).
- **Routing**: For each command, check whether it explicitly routes to the orchestrator (e.g. a Routing section that delegates to `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` and states a mode). Document that Claude’s entry is “commands” and note any difference from Cursor (e.g. missing Routing sections).
- **Orchestrator**: Verify `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` (or equivalent) exists and defines modes / agent usage.
- **Agents**: Confirm agents in `.claude/agents/` have their own skill references.
- **Report**: Note any command without orchestrator routing; note any agent without skill references.

### 3. Google Anthropic — Agent (`.agent/`)

- **Entry**: Start from `.agent/workflows/` (do **not** use a commands directory; this platform uses workflows). List all workflow files (same 17 names: brainstorm, create, debug, deploy, docs, enhance, explain, fix, implement, orchestrate, plan, preview, refactor, review, status, test, ui-ux-pro-max).
- **Routing**: For each workflow, verify it connects to the orchestrator and a mode (e.g. a Routing section or equivalent that references `.agent/agents/orchestrator.md` and the mode).
- **Orchestrator**: Verify `.agent/agents/orchestrator.md` exists and defines modes / agent usage.
- **Agents**: Confirm agents in `.agent/agents/` have their own skill references.
- **Report**: Note any workflow that does not reference the orchestrator or mode; note any agent without skill references.

### 4. Cross-cutting

- **No cycles**: Confirm that skills do not call commands or the orchestrator, and that agents do not call commands. (Check skill and agent docs for any such references.)
- **Output**: Produce the structured report and gaps/recommendations as specified in the “Output format” section below.

## Verification checklist (use in your review)

Before finalizing your report, ensure you have:

- [ ] Listed and checked all **Cursor** commands (17); for each, verified Routing → orchestrator + mode or documented exception.
- [ ] Listed and checked all **Claude** commands (17); documented entry = commands and routing/orchestrator alignment (or gaps).
- [ ] Listed and checked all **Agent** workflows (17); documented entry = workflows and routing/orchestrator alignment (or gaps).
- [ ] Verified each platform’s orchestrator has a defined mode table or equivalent.
- [ ] Verified each agent (per platform) has explicit skill references.
- [ ] Checked for cycles: skills must not call commands or orchestrator; agents must not call commands.
- [ ] Produced a per-platform flow report and a gaps/recommendations section.

## Output format

Provide your response in the following structure.

### Per-platform flow report

For **Cursor**, **Claude**, and **Agent**, output:

```markdown
