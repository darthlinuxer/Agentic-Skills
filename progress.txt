## Sun Feb 22 17:30:00 -03 2026 - AS-001
- What was implemented
  - Explored Agentic-Skills directory structure across all platforms
  - Documented skill counts per platform
  - Identified duplicate skills across platforms

- Files changed
  - prd.json (updated passes to true for AS-001)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Massive skill overlap: 67-68 skills are duplicated across .agent, .claude, and .cursor platforms
  - Each platform has similar structure: skills/, agents/, scripts/, plus platform-specific dirs
  - .agent has workflows/, .claude has commands/, .cursor has commands/ and rules/
  - Each skill directory contains SKILL.md file
  - Agent files are in .md format in agents/ directories

## Sun Feb 22 17:40:00 -03 2026 - AS-002
- What was implemented
  - Researched skill format for all three platforms (.agent, .claude, .cursor)
  - Documented differences in agents, commands, workflows, and rules formats
  - Identified format consistency and platform-specific variations

- Files changed
  - prd.json (updated passes to true for AS-002)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Skills format is consistent: SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter (name, description)
  - Agents format differs: .agent/.cursor use YAML frontmatter (name, description, model, color), .claude uses plain markdown with "Referenced skills" section
  - .agent uses workflows/ with YAML frontmatter (trigger, description)
  - .claude and .cursor use commands/ with "$ARGUMENTS" section and "Before answering" preamble
  - .cursor agents include "Workspace Integration" section not present in other platforms
  - .cursor has no rules/ directory (unlike .agent which has rules/)
  - Root level skills/ directory exists with 2 skills (prd, ralph)
