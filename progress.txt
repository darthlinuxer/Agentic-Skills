## Sun Feb 22 17:30:00 -03 2026 - AS-001
- What was implemented
  - Explored Agentic-Skills directory structure across all platforms
  - Documented skill counts per platform
  - Identified duplicate skills across platforms

- Files changed
  - prd.json (updated passes to true for AS-001)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Massive skill overlap: 67-68 skills are duplicated across .agent, .claude, and .cursor platforms
  - Each platform has similar structure: skills/, agents/, scripts/, plus platform-specific dirs
  - .agent has workflows/, .claude has commands/, .cursor has commands/ and rules/
  - Each skill directory contains SKILL.md file
  - Agent files are in .md format in agents/ directories
