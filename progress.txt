# Agentic-Skills Assessment Progress Log
Started: Sun Feb 22 17:26:39 -03 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- All 67 common skills have DIFFERENT content across platforms - major conflict requiring resolution
- 16 skills differ between .claude and .cursor (most similar): architecture, create-rule, create-subagent, geo-fundamentals, intelligent-routing, lint-and-validate, mcp-builder, mobile-design, parallel-agents, senior-agile-pm-budget-analyst, senior-software-developer, sequential-thinking, update-cursor-settings, using-superpowers, writing-prompts, writing-skills
- doc.md in .agent/skills/ is not a skill but documentation that was incorrectly placed
- gemini skill is duplicated in both .agent and .claude
- Skills follow kebab-case naming consistently (except doc.md which is malformed)
- 18 common agents across platforms with potential content differences

## Sun Feb 22 18:30:00 -03 2026 - AS-005
- What was implemented
  - Analyzed run-validations.sh script and its validation steps
  - Traced how commands/workflows connect to agents and skills
  - Documented the full agent/skill interaction flow
  - Ran validation checks - all passed

- Files changed
  - prd.json (updated passes to true for AS-005)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Flow: User invokes /command → Command file in commands/ or workflows/ → Routes to Agent with mode parameter → Agent invokes sub-agents and skills
  - Platform isolation is strictly enforced: links must stay within same platform (no cross-platform links)
  - Commands in .claude/commands/ and .cursor/commands/ are nearly identical (both route to agent-orchestrator)
  - .agent/workflows/ uses YAML frontmatter format, while .claude/.cursor use $ARGUMENTS pattern
  - All commands delegate to orchestrator agent with mode parameter (e.g., mode="create", mode="implement")
  - Validations pass: 67-68 skills per platform, 0 dangling references, all links valid
  - Key issue from AS-003 still applies: skills referenced in agents have different content across platforms

## Sun Feb 22 18:00:00 -03 2026 - AS-004
- What was implemented
  - Validated all skills against platform formatting guidelines
  - Checked each skill has required SKILL.md file
  - Verified YAML frontmatter with name and description fields
  - Checked for naming consistency and common errors

- Files changed
  - prd.json (updated passes to true for AS-004)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - All three platforms follow consistent skill format: SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter
  - .claude has 68 skills, .agent has 68 skills, .cursor has 67 skills
  - doc.md in .agent/skills/ is documentation about creating skills - not a valid skill
  - All skills follow kebab-case naming (verified across all platforms)
  - Template files (TEMPLATE.md) exist in app-builder templates with same frontmatter format
  - Validation passed - skills are properly formatted per platform guidelines

## Sun Feb 22 17:30:00 -03 2026 - AS-001
- What was implemented
  - Explored Agentic-Skills directory structure across all platforms
  - Documented skill counts per platform
  - Identified duplicate skills across platforms

- Files changed
  - prd.json (updated passes to true for AS-001)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Massive skill overlap: 67-68 skills are duplicated across .agent, .claude, and .cursor platforms
  - Each platform has similar structure: skills/, agents/, scripts/, plus platform-specific dirs
  - .agent has workflows/, .claude has commands/, .cursor has commands/ and rules/
  - Each skill directory contains SKILL.md file
  - Agent files are in .md format in agents/ directories

## Sun Feb 22 17:40:00 -03 2026 - AS-002
- What was implemented
  - Researched skill format for all three platforms (.agent, .claude, .cursor)
  - Documented differences in agents, commands, workflows, and rules formats
  - Identified format consistency and platform-specific variations

- Files changed
  - prd.json (updated passes to true for AS-002)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Skills format is consistent: SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter (name, description)
  - Agents format differs: .agent/.cursor use YAML frontmatter (name, description, model, color), .claude uses plain markdown with "Referenced skills" section
  - .agent uses workflows/ with YAML frontmatter (trigger, description)
  - .claude and .cursor use commands/ with "$ARGUMENTS" section and "Before answering" preamble
  - .cursor agents include "Workspace Integration" section not present in other platforms
  - .cursor has no rules/ directory (unlike .agent which has rules/)
  - Root level skills/ directory exists with 2 skills (prd, ralph)

## Sun Feb 22 17:50:00 -03 2026 - AS-003
- What was implemented
  - Compared skills across all three platforms (.agent, .claude, .cursor)
  - Identified that all 67 common skills have DIFFERENT content across platforms - major conflict
  - Found 16 skills differ between .claude and .cursor (most similar platforms)
  - Checked naming consistency - found doc.md incorrectly placed in .agent/skills
  - Identified gemini skill duplicated in .agent and .claude

- Files changed
  - prd.json (updated passes to true for AS-003)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Critical finding: Every skill with the same name has different content across platforms - this defeats the purpose of skill sharing
  - .claude and .cursor are most similar (only 16 skills differ) while .agent differs from both
  - doc.md should be moved out of skills/ directory - it's documentation, not a skill
  - Need to decide on single source of truth for each skill or implement a merge/consolidation strategy
  - Agents also exist (18 common) but need separate analysis for content conflicts
